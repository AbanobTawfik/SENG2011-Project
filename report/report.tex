\section{Executive Summary}
Project Vampire is an electronic records management system for the handling of medical blood inventories.

\fixindent{}The project aims to replace paper-based records systems, with the usual benefits of digital records management - such as reducing costs and improving usability. However, there are some concerns as to whether a digital system can be relied upon to manage a critical resource with human lives at stake. To provide assurance, our system uses formal verification techniques to ensure that it conforms to safety requirements.

\fixindent{}Our system integrates with pre-existing business processes of blood inventory management. For example, there are built-in processes for the expiration of blood, distinction between blood types, requests and acceptance of donated blood, to list a few.

\fixindent{}Our system comprises of a graphical interface that interacts with a verified data store service. The implementation details will be detailed in their respective sections.

\fixindent{}Our final project and report will describe a minimum viable product to demonstrate that safety and assurance requirements can be met with a digital records management system.
